## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had the opportunity to gain more experience working with Flexbox and using CSS Grid for the first time. Working on this challenge has made me more comfortable applying Flexbox to projects. It has also gave me the opportunity to practice using the properties of CSS grid. Specifically, I mainly practiced placing columns and rows with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows as well as moving around elements in the grid using grid-column and grid-row properties. This project mainly revolved using CSS Grid overall.

### Continued development

I believe that I will need additional practice with CSS Grid in order to be more comfortable using it. I will need to learn how I can apply Flexbox and CSS Grid in future challenges/projects I may come across in the future. Also, this project is not responsive at the moment. Will plan to making it responsive in the future.
